Storytelling</h3>
<p>Every course should have an engaging, continuous narrative – for example,
based on real-life applications (<em>“predicting the weather”</em>), historical
events (<em>“measuring the height of Mount Everest”</em>), a mathematical puzzle
(<em>“which shapes tessellate”</em>) or even fictional characters. After starting
with some general exposition, we should arrive at a new problem that students
can’t solve, and then develop new mathematics that’s required. There could
even be some suspense: students don’t initially know where the story might
lead, and are later surprised with a powerful mathematical result. This approach
should motivate students, make the content more memorable, and justify why
what students are learning is useful or important.</p>
<h3>2. User Interactions</h3>
<p>Every Mathigon course is divided into small steps. Usually, these should not
be longer than 2-3 paragraphs of text, and at every step, there needs to be
something to do for the user. These can be simple multiple-choice questions
or fill-in-the-blanks, or more complex games and interactive environment. The
goal is to make students learn in a more <em>active</em> way, and verify that they
are understanding the content (rather than just scrolling down the page).</p>
<h3>3. Exploration and Open Play</h3>
<p>When possible, try introducing a new topic with an open-ended environment
where students can play, explore, and even discover some initial concepts on
their own. This usually works well for very good student, but might not be as
effective for weaker and less-experienced students. To help these students, it
makes sense to include some scaffolding like ideas what to try, or a list of
statements out of which students have to pick the correct/possible ones.</p>
<p>As a whole, this step should be non-blocking. After a set time, or a specific
number of actions, the next step is revealed and students are walked through
the essential mathematical concepts in more detail.</p>
<h3>4. Questions</h3>
<p>Avoid asking students direct questions (<em>“What is the sum of 3 and 4?”</em>) and
instead write a statement that students have to complete (<em>“The sum of 3 and
4 is ___.”</em>). This should make the content feel more accessible, like working
with a personal tutor rather than listening to a lecture. It should appear to
students almost as if they are writing their own textbook.</p>
<p>Blanks are some of the easiest interactive elements to create, and despite their
simplicity they can be very effective. They can be multiple choice questions,
number inputs (exact numbers as well as number ranges), or equation inputs. In
all those cases, try to chose blanks that test students understanding of the key
mathematical concepts, rather than just their arithmetic skills.</p>
<p>It can also be very effective to have multiple-choice questions to which
students don't yet know the answer. They have to look at all the possible
options, and then decide which one works or makes the most sense.</p>
<h3>5. Tone and Pronouns</h3>
<p>Overall, the tone should be kept as neutral and factual as possible. Rather
than referring directly to the author (“I”) or student (“you”), assume that
you are working together (“we” or “let’s”). This allows students to feel more
autonomous and independent, rather than being lectured at.</p>
<h3>6. Illustrations and Graphics</h3>
<p>When scrolling though a course, the browser viewport should always contain some
colour like illustrations or diagrams (except on very small screens like
smartphones). These can either be mathematical diagrams directly related to the
text, or they can be more generic illustrations that relate to the current
topic and make it more visually appealing.</p>
<p>Illustrations should always be photo-realistic (no “clip-arts”). Diagrams should
be SVGs and follow the Mathigon style for colours, fonts, line thicknesses, etc.</p>
<h3>6. Inline Elements</h3>
<p>Mathigon supports a number of different inline elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blanks</strong> (blue boxes): see section 4 for details. Blanks are always
blocking the next step, meaning that students have to answer them before
being able to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>Variable sliders</strong> (red boxes): these allow students to change the value of
a specific variable in the text, and watch what happens to other numbers or
diagrams. They are an easy way to make examples less specific, by letting
students pick the input. They also allow students to find &quot;patterns&quot; in the
result. Like blanks, variable sliders are blocking. Students have to move
every slider in a step, before being able to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>Glossary and biography entries</strong> (yellow underlines): when hovering, these
elements reveal boxes with more details about the word or person. Glossary
entries also allow linking to other Mathigon courses with more details.
They are optional and non-blocking.</li>
<li><strong>Hover targets</strong> (green underlines): when hovering, these reveal an arrow
that can point to specific elements on the page (words, diagrams, etc.), or
they can highlight a specific part of a geometric diagram.</li>
<li><strong>Pills</strong> (rounded boxes in different coloured): these are similar to hover
targets, but can appear in lots of different colours, usually matching the
colour of the corresponding elements in a diagram.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Use of Colours</h3>
<p>When showing complex diagrams or equations, it often makes sense to highlight
specific variables or parts of the diagram in different colours. You can then
use <em>pills</em> (see above) to refer to these elements in the text, and highlight
them when hovering.</p>
<h3>8. List and Table Data</h3>
<p>Structured data should never be represented in a long sentence: always use
tables or bullet lists instead (ideally with colours, icons or diagrams).</p>
<h3>9. Writing Style</h3>
<p>Remember that Mathigon is targeted at children, some of which might still
struggle with reading. Sentences should be short and concise, avoid
unnecessarily complex words, and paragraphs should not be longer than 4-5
lines of text.</p>
